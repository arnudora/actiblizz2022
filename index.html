        WE BELIEVE VETERANS BRING INCREDIBLE VALUE TO OUR COMPANY AND SOCIETY
      </div>
      <div id="believe02_01">
        Veterans are not just patriots; they are assets to our economy and
        society. In 2009, Activision Blizzard founded the Call of Duty
        Endowment, a non-profit dedicated to finding, funding and growing the
        most efficient and effective job placement services for veterans. In
        2013, our employees founded the Veterans and Friends Employee Network,
        an affinity group of Activision veterans and their supporters designed
        to create meaningful, lasting connections between our veteran employees,
        their friends and supporters, and the larger employee community, while
        enabling our veteran employees to reach their full potential.

        We hire veterans because we’d like to see more of you in our industry.
        While we're known for our world-class franchises and groundbreaking

          Activision is committed to hiring qualified veterans to our teams
          because our experience shows you will do an incredible job. It’s not
          just us; research shows that veterans out-perform their non-veteran
          counterparts in many important areas to businesses like ours,
          including Leadership and Cooperation, Loyalty, Teamwork, Resilience,
          Technical Acumen, and Cross-Cultural Experience.

        <div id="more1Right03">
          Unfortunately, there aren’t as many veterans working in our industry
          as we’d like to see. To combat this, we’ve developed this ‘insider’s
          guide’ to give you a leg-up in breaking into our world. In this guide,
          you’ll discover more about who we are, what we do and what we value in
          our employees, giving you a unique insight into how to join our team.

        <div id="more2Left02">
          The Call of Duty Endowment was co-founded by Activision Blizzard CEO
          Bobby Kotick. In 2007, during a veterans initiative in Los Angeles,
          Bobby realized that veteran projects too often focused on symbolism,
          such as creating monuments and naming public parks. Few, however,
          provided the tangible resource veterans most needed: jobs.
        </div>
        <div id="more2Left03">
          To date the Endowment has funded the placement of over 100,000
          veterans into high-quality careers by identifying and funding the most
          efficient and effective organizations that get unemployed veterans
          back to work. Visit the Call of Duty Endowment for more detailed
          information on how you can benefit from or support its efforts.

      <div id="day02">
        On Veterans Day 2014, Activision launched its first annual Veterans Day
        of Service. Hundreds of Activision employees loaded up on buses and
        traveled to work sites around the Greater Los Angeles and Minneapolis
        areas to support local veteran organizations. Fast forward to 2018, over
        800 employees from across each of our independent game development
        studios and divisions volunteered their time and came together in
        service of 28 veteran organizations across 30 project sites in the US
        and UK.
        <br />
        <br />
        From painting to landscaping, to preparing meal packs and sorting
        warehouses of donated food for homeless veterans, our service projects
        are designed to meet the outstanding needs of those local organizations.
        In 2018, we also coordinated a special Veterans Day of Service for our
        summer interns to give them a sense of our commitment to service and
        what the veteran community means to us. The Day of Service is a way for
        our employees to directly show support for veterans and helps create a
        sense of community with our teams.
        <br />
        <br />
        For many of us it’s one of the best days of the year.
